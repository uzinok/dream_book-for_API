						<p>While cats are secretive and sly creatures able to roam wherever they want, kittens are another story. Small, helpless, tender, and so defenseless. You just want to cuddle and protect them. However, interpretation of dreams about kittens is not that simple, so let's see what the dreambook says about kittens in dreams.</p>
						<p>According to Vanga's dreambook, seeing kittens in your dreams is associated with the expectation of trouble. For example, if a woman sees a cute fluffy white kitten, she will almost certainly fall into a trap. There is a way out - to treat the situation in cold blood and carefully analyze the situation. Did you see many kittens? Be cautious, since the dreambook states that seeing kittens in large numbers may lead to problems that will literally haunt you. What does dreaming about dirty and weak kittens mean? Alas, you should be prepared for being deceived. According to Vanga's dreambook, to destroy a kitten in a dream is to cope with trouble in reality. What a cruel way!</p>
